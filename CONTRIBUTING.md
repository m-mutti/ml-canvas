- **PyTorch**: Export utilities for PyTorch datasets
- **Hugging Face**: Integration with Hugging Face datasets
- **Roboflow**: Direct upload to Roboflow projects

#### âš¡ Performance Optimizations
- **WebGL Rendering**: Hardware-accelerated drawing
- **Canvas Offloading**: Web Worker support for heavy operations
- **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of large images/datasets
- **Touch/Mobile Support**: Better mobile annotation experience

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-canvas.git
   cd ml-canvas
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   npm run test:unit
   ```

### Development Guidelines

#### Code Style
- Follow the existing Vue 3 Composition API patterns
- Use TypeScript for type safety where applicable
- Maintain separation between canvas operations and ML data formats
- Keep coordinate system transformations isolated and well-documented

#### Architecture Principles
- **Event-Driven**: Use Vue's reactive system and custom events
- **Modular**: Each drawing mode should be self-contained
- **Extensible**: Make it easy to add new tools and export formats
- **ML-First**: Always consider the end ML use case

#### Adding New Drawing Modes

When adding a new drawing mode, follow this pattern:

1. **Add mode to validator** in `drawingMode` prop
2. **Implement mouse handlers** for the new mode
3. **Create shape creation function** that returns both canvas and image coordinates
4. **Add preview drawing function** for real-time feedback
5. **Add redraw logic** for persisting shapes
6. **Update documentation** and examples

Example structure:
```javascript
// In handleMouseDown
else if (props.drawingMode === 'newmode') {
  // Initialize drawing state
}

// In handleMouseMove  
else if (props.drawingMode === 'newmode') {
  // Update preview
  redrawCanvas()
  drawNewModePreview()
}

// In handleMouseUp
else if (props.drawingMode === 'newmode') {
  const shape = createNewModeShape()
  if (shape) {
    drawnShapes.value.push(shape)
    emit('shape-created', shape)
    redrawCanvas()
  }
}
```

#### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Test shape creation logic and coordinate transformations
- **Integration Tests**: Test drawing interactions and events
- **Visual Tests**: Ensure drawing modes work correctly across browsers
- **Performance Tests**: Verify performance with large datasets

#### Documentation

When contributing, please:
- Update the README if adding user-facing features
- Add JSDoc comments for new functions
- Include usage examples for new drawing modes
- Update the API reference table
